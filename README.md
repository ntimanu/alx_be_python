# ALX Python Introduction

This repository contains Python scripts for introductory programming tasks. Each task is designed to practice basic Python concepts, including arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and formula implementation.

## Tasks

### 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise

**Objective**: Practice basic arithmetic operations in Python.

**Script**: `basic_operations.py`  
This script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) with two predefined numbers.

### 1. Simple Interest Calculator

**Objective**
To practice basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments by calculating the simple interest on an investment over a specific period.

**Script**: `simple_interest.py`
This script calculates the **Simple Interest (I)** earned on an investment using the formula:  
**I = P _ R _ T**, where:

- **I** is the interest earned.
- **P** is the principal amount (initial investment).
- **R** is the annual interest rate (as a decimal).
- **T** is the time (in years) for which the money is invested.

### 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

**Objective**
To practice Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments by calculating the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

**Script**: `rectangle_area.py`
This script calculates the **area of a rectangle** using the formula:  
**Area = length × width**, where:

- **`length`** is the length of the rectangle.
- **`width`** is the width of the rectangle.

### 3. Convert Hours to Seconds

**Objective**
To practice variable assignments and arithmetic operations by converting a given number of hours into seconds.

**Script**: `hours_to_seconds.py`
This script convert hours to seconds.

### 4. User Input Age Calculator

**Objective**
Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

**Script**: `future_age_calculator.py`
This script takes age of the user and calculate age the user will be in 2050 and return the future age.

### 5. Personal Finance Calculator

**Objective**
Use user input, variables, and arithmetic operations to calculate and provide feedback on a user’s monthly savings and potential future savings without applying conditional statements.

**Script**: `finance_calculator.py`
This script will calculate the user’s monthly savings based on inputted monthly income and expenses. It will then project these savings over a year, assuming a fixed interest rate, to demonstrate compound interest’s effect on savings.
